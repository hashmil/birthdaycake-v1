# birthdaycake-v1

Working in a company where there are 500+ employees there is bound to be a birthday every day of the year.

**What if** there was a way to know who's birthday it was today, and where they sit in the building?

This is an attempt to build that app.

Made using PHP and mySQL. As you can see from the code, i'm a novice at this!

Currently on Heroku - **[link to app](http://birthdaycakeeveryday.herokuapp.com/)**
